	            A good translator will provide a quote at the beginning of an assignment and will agree on a deadline with the project coordinator. It is the responsibility of the translator to only accept translations that are within their area of expertise.
	            A good translator does not miss their deadline! They are responsible for managing their time efficiently and allowing extra time for unexpected difficulties.
	            However, when unexpected situations occur and a good translator realizes that they will not be able to complete an assignment they let the project coordinator know IMMEDIATELY. Good translators also ensure that they back up their work, as computer crashes are not an acceptable reason for missing your deadline.

	            Translators are freelance workers who generally work alone without supervision. This means that the translator should be self-motivated to complete their work on time, and should also possess time management skills to ensure their work load is manageable.
	            Translators are encouraged to touch base with the Project Coordinator for questions and clarification but being able to work independently is a key attribute for translators.

	        <div class="according-content" style="display: none;">
	            A translator should be familiar with the cultural nuances of the languages he/she is translating into/from. Translators act as cultural mediators and need to ensure the target text is appropriate for the end-users.
	            A translator should be proficient in typing into their target language using the appropriate keyboard and font. Many translators work with a computer-aided translation tool, or CAT tool in order to increase the quality of their work and to be more productive. Even when not using a CAT tool, being familiar with technology is crucial for translators; all translators have to know how computers and different software programs work and be able to learn to use new tools easily.

	        <div class="according-content" style="display: none;">
	            Translators must have the readiness and ability to research. Often times a client will provide reference material and preferred terminology, but additional research is regularly required in order to produce a high quality translation.

	        <div class="according-content" style="display: none;">
	            Good translators should ensure that they follow the instructions set out by the client and/or project coordinator. They also use the reference materials and preferred terminology indicated to complete the assignment. Good translators must also double check their work and aim for 100% accuracy, by staying as close as possible to the source text and confirming name spellings and dates with the Project Coordinator.
